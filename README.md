# Mixtube

Mixtube is a web application that let you create queues of videos and automatically cross-fades them so that you get a continuous stream of music. The only compatible video provider for now is YouTube but more will be added.

## Getting started
For now, the only way to try Mixtube is to clone the GitHub repo and visit the index page through a web server.
